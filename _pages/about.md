This is Yuxuan's home on the web!

I studied Formal Linguistics in Beijing Normal University during my undergraduate period, and my undergraduate thesis is related to the comparison of Chinese and Japanese languages. I am now studying in Tsinghua University, studying Computational Linguistics. I am interested in analyzing historical language evolution through data science methods.

Of course, I have a deep curiosity about everything related to language!
